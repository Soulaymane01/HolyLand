        <h1>Jerusalem: A Holy City for Muslims (638 CE)</h1>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Following the Arab conquest of the Holy Land in 638 CE, Jerusalem, already a sacred city for Jews and Christians,  gained a profound significance for Muslims. The city became the third holiest site in Islam, alongside Mecca and Medina, a testament to its deep spiritual importance within the Islamic faith.  The construction of the Dome of the Rock, a magnificent Islamic shrine on the Temple Mount, further cemented Jerusalem's prominence in the Islamic world, marking the site of the Prophet Muhammad's ascension to heaven.</p>

            <h2>Jerusalem in Islamic Tradition:</h2>

            <p>Jerusalem, known as Al-Quds in Arabic, holds a significant place in Islamic tradition.  Muslims believe that the Prophet Muhammad, during his Night Journey (Isra' and Mi'raj),  ascended to heaven from the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This event, described in the Quran,  is believed to have taken place during the prophet's time in Mecca.  The Temple Mount, known in Islamic tradition as the Noble Sanctuary (al-Haram al-Sharif),  is considered a sacred site,  where Muhammad is said to have met with God.</p>

            <h2>The Construction of the Dome of the Rock:</h2>

            <p>The Dome of the Rock, an awe-inspiring structure built on the Temple Mount, was commissioned by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik in 691 CE.  This magnificent shrine, adorned with intricate mosaics and featuring a gilded dome,  became a symbol of Islamic faith and a testament to the spiritual significance of Jerusalem.  The Dome of the Rock,  along with the nearby Al-Aqsa Mosque,  are the two most important Islamic sites in Jerusalem,  drawing millions of Muslim pilgrims from around the world.</p>

            <h2>Jerusalem as a Holy City:</h2>

            <p>The Arab conquest and the subsequent construction of the Dome of the Rock elevated Jerusalem's status as a holy city in the Islamic world.  The city became a center of Islamic scholarship and pilgrimage, drawing Muslims to its sacred sites.  Jerusalem's status as a holy city for Jews, Christians, and Muslims, with its diverse religious communities, has continued to shape its complex and often contested history.</p>

            <h2>The Ongoing Significance of Jerusalem:</h2>

            <p>Jerusalem's significance as a holy city for three major religions,  with its sacred sites and its enduring spiritual importance,  continues to shape the region's political and social landscape.  The city remains a center of religious pilgrimage and a place of deep devotion for millions of people around the world.  The complex religious and political history of Jerusalem continues to make it a focus of international attention and a source of ongoing discussions about peace and coexistence.</p>
